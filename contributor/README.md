### GIT FORK

**A fork creates a completely independent copy of Git repository.**Â **In contrast to a fork, a Git clone creates a linked copy that will continue to synchronize with the target repository**.

**When to Use Git Fork**

Generally, forking a repository allows us to experiment on the project without affecting the original project. Following are the reasons for forking the repository

- Find the GitHub repository which you want to fork.

- Click the Fork button on the upper right side of the repository's page.

- Pull request if you finish

## Fork vs. Clone

Sometimes people considered the fork as clone command because of their property. Both commands are used to create another copy of the repository. But the significant difference is that the fork is used to create a server-side copy, and clone is used to create a local copy of the repository.

There is no particular command for forking the repository; instead, it is a service provided by third-party Git service like GitHub. Comparatively, git clone is a command-line utility that is used to create a local copy of the project.

Generally, people working on the same project clone the repository and the external contributors fork the repository.

A pull request can merge the changes made on the fork repository. We can create a pull request to propose changes to the project. Comparatively, changes made on the cloned repository can be merged by pushing. We can push the changes to our remote repository.
