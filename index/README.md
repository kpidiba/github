# Git Index

The Git index is a staging area between the working directory and repository. It is used to build up a set of changes that you want to commit together. To better understand the Git index, then first understand the working directory and repository.

There are three places in Git where file changes can reside, and these are working directory, staging area, and the repository. To better understand the Git index first, let's take a quick view of these places.

### Working directory:

When you worked on your project and made some changes, you are dealing with your project's working directory. This project directory is available on your computer's filesystem. All the changes you make will remain in the working directory until you add them to the staging area.

### Staging area:

The staging area can be described as a preview of your next commit. When you create a git commit, Git takes changes that are in the staging area and make them as a new commit. You are allowed to add and remove changes from the staging area. The staging area can be considered as a real area where git stores the changes.



## Check your Remote

To check the configuration of the remote server, run the **git remote** command. The git remote command allows accessing the connection between remote and local.

```git

```
